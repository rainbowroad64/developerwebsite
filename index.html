Hi my name is Laz if im not playing video games in my spare time im usually watching anime or binge watching netflix. <br>
My favorite films so far in order are Zombieland, Intersteller, Venom, Alita Battle Angel and Deadpool.<br>
I am very much into coding its a blast so far. its a lot of work but its fun so far. I decided to study code <br>
because i play a lot of video games and wanted to know how the code side works of it.
